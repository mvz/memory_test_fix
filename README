MemoryTestFix
=============

A simple fix to run tests with sqlite. From example at

http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2006/02/08/in-memory-sqlite-database-for-rails-testing

In your database.yml, use

  test:
    adapter: sqlite3
    database: ":memory:"
  
It runs much faster!

You can also adjust the verbosity of the output:

test:
  adapter: sqlite3
  database: ":memory:"
  verbosity: silent
