MemoryTestFix
=============

A simple fix to run tests with sqlite. From example at

http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2006/02/08/in-memory-sqlite-database-for-rails-testing

Install the gem:

  gem install memory_test_fix

In your config/environments.rb, use:

  config.gem 'memory_test_fix'

In your database.yml, use:

  test:
    adapter: sqlite3
    database: ":memory:"

It runs much faster!

You can also adjust the verbosity of the output:

  test:
    adapter: sqlite3
    database: ":memory:"
    verbosity: silent

You can also use this with other (testing) environments, not just 'test'.
