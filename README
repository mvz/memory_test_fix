MemoryTestFix
=============

A simple fix to run your Rails tests with sqlite. From the example at

http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2006/02/08/in-memory-sqlite-database-for-rails-testing

Install the gem:

  gem install memory_test_fix

In your config/environments.rb, use:

  config.gem 'memory_test_fix'

In your database.yml, use:

  test:
    adapter: sqlite3
    database: ":memory:"

It runs much faster!

You can also adjust the verbosity of the output:

  test:
    adapter: sqlite3
    database: ":memory:"
    verbosity: silent

You can also use this with other (testing) environments, not just 'test'.

== Rails Versions

Due to incompatibilities in the loading of gem plugins by Rails, this gem
only works with Rails 3 starting from version 0.2.0. If you're using an
older version of Rails, use the 0.1.x version of this gem.
